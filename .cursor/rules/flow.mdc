# CrewAI Flow Development Guidelines

## Flow Structure
- Implement flows as classes that inherit from `Flow[StateType]`
- Define a state model using Pydantic BaseModel
- Include methods for each step in the flow
- Use the `@start()` decorator for the entry point
- Use the `@listen()` decorator for subsequent steps
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous execution

## Output Format Handling
- Always include `output_format` in your state model
- Support both 'markdown' and 'json' formats
- Validate the output format in the initial step
- Provide helper methods for formatting output

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling for each step
- Use try/except blocks for critical operations
- Provide fallback responses for error cases
- Log errors with appropriate detail
