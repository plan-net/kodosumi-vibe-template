## General Patterns to Avoid
- Avoid implementing agent frameworks from scratch, use CrewAI

## Patterns to Avoid
- Avoid using threading or multiprocessing directly, prefer Ray
- Avoid implementing custom serving solutions, use Kodosumi
- Avoid using other web search tools when exa.ai can be used
- Avoid implementing custom web search solutions
- Avoid hardcoding output formats without providing options for both human and agent consumption
- Avoid returning raw JSON to human users without proper formatting
- Avoid deploying to Kodosumi without first testing locally with Ray
- Avoid assuming Ray is always initialized in the environment
- Avoid using FastAPI directly, use kodosumi.serve.ServeAPI instead
- Avoid skipping the Kodosumi spooler when deploying services
- Avoid manual deployment without using Ray Serve's config.yaml
