## Key Principle
- follow test-driven development best-practices and work a lot with pytest
- develop user requirements step-by-step by writing the test first and then implement the feature against it
- write tests for single crews, the main flow and the serve application

## Rules to take into account
- when you install and setup the project make sure to consider all installation rules
- when you work on a crew make sure to consider all crews rules
- when you work on a flow make sure to consider all flow rules
- when you work on the html make sure to consider all html rules
- when running or testing the app make sure to consider all testing rules
- when you do anything related to kodosumi and serving make sure to consider the kodosumi rules
- always consider the frameworks rules when writing new features
