# Kodosumi related instruction

## Recommended Patterns
- keep the [config.yaml](mdc:config.yaml) on point with human readable names in line with the project name for name and route
- always use as the import_path the [serve.py](mdc:workflows/crewai_flow/serve.py) fastapp, which is the Ray Serve binding
- never forget to set all ENV VARS in the config.yaml which are needed for the application
- always make sure you have the GET "/" endpoint to render the HTML and capture the inputs
- always makre sure you have the PPST "/" endpoint to start the flow execution with the form
- the user can open the Ray Dashboard under http://localhost:8265/#/overview

 ## Avoid Patterns
 - Avoid using FastAPI directly, use kodosumi.serve.ServeAPI instead
