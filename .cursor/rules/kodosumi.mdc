# Kodosumi Integration for CrewAI Flows

## Configuration
- Update `config.yaml` with your workflow configuration. Like for example:
  ```yaml
  applications:
    - name: crewai_flow
      route_prefix: /crewai_flow
      import_path: workflows.crewai_flow.serve:fast_app
      runtime_env:
        env_vars:
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
          EXA_API_KEY: ${EXA_API_KEY}
          OTEL_SDK_DISABLED: "true"
  ```

- Set up environment variables in `.env` file:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  EXA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```

## Troubleshooting
- If Ray is not connecting, check if Ray is running with `ray status`
- If deployment fails, check the Ray Serve logs with `serve logs crewai_flow`
- If the web interface shows errors, check the Kodosumi service logs
- For API endpoint issues, try direct access with `curl http://localhost:8001/crewai_flow/`

## Best Practices
- Always test locally before deploying
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Monitor Ray dashboard at http://localhost:8265
- Keep the Kodosumi spooler running for background tasks
- Restart services in the correct order if issues occur
