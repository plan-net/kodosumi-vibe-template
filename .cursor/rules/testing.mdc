 # Testing Strategy

 ## First Step: Running locally with Ray
 - always run the application on the local Ray Cluster first
 - for this just call the __main__ block in the main flow file
 - make sure the Ray Head is already running in the background
 - if not start it with "ray start --head" in the terminal first before you test it
 - sometimes it helps to execute "ray stop" and start the head again if you run into unexpected ray related problems

 ## Second Step: Deploying in local or remote Kodosumi (optional)
 - only if the local test succeeds ask the user if you should deploy to Kodosumi too
 - when testing on Kodosumi locally the Ray Head and the Kodosumu Spooler must be running
 - you need to deploy the [config.yaml](mdc:config.yaml) file to Kodosumi
 - you only need to redeploy the [config.yaml](mdc:config.yaml) if you have made changes to it


 ## Avoid Patterns
 - Avoid assuming Ray is always initialized in the environment
 - Avoid starting and stopping the Spooler every time
