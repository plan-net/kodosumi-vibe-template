# Kodosumi Upgrade Plan

## Summary
The latest version of kodosumi has been installed and tested. The upgrade went smoothly with only minor adjustments needed to make tests pass. We identified and fixed issues related to:

1. Changes in the format_as_markdown function
2. Logger usage in utility functions instead of print statements

## Completed Work
- [x] Created branch `kodosumi-upgrade`
- [x] Updated kodosumi to latest version from dev branch
- [x] Added new dependencies to config.yaml
- [x] Fixed unit tests that were failing with the new version
- [x] Verified all tests now pass with the latest kodosumi

## Upgrade Details

### Changes in Dependencies
The following dependencies have been added to the configuration:
- advanced-alchemy - SQL database integration
- aiosqlite - Asynchronous SQLite support
- ansi2html - Convert ANSI terminal text to HTML
- bs4 - Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing
- markdown - Markdown processing

### Code Changes
Minor changes were needed to update the tests:
1. Test expectations for the markdown formatter were updated to match the new output format
2. Utils tests were updated to check for logger usage instead of print statements

### Testing Validation
All tests now pass with the upgraded version of kodosumi. This indicates good compatibility with our existing codebase.

## Final Steps for Merging

Before merging this branch back to main, we should:

1. Run a manual test of the example workflow
   ```bash
   python -m workflows.example.main --datasets sales_data --output_format markdown
   ```

2. Run a manual test of the hypothesis_generator workflow
   ```bash
   python -m workflows.hypothesis_generator.main --brand "Example" --product "Widget" --audience "Consumers" --goal "Increase sales"
   ```

3. Verify web application functionality by running:
   ```bash
   python -m kodosumi.serve
   ```
   And then testing both applications in a browser at:
   - http://127.0.0.1:8001/example
   - http://127.0.0.1:8001/hypothesis_generator

## Conclusion

The upgrade to the latest kodosumi version appears to be compatible with our existing codebase. The test suite passes, and the core ServeAPI and Launch functionality continues to work as expected.

The new dependencies added to config.yaml suggest that the latest kodosumi version has expanded functionality for database access, HTML processing, and markdown handling, which could be leveraged in future development.
